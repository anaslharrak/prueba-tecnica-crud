# PRUEBA TÃ‰CNICA NODE.JS Y REACT

### ðŸš§ Project in progress ðŸš§

The objective of this challenge is to create a web application to display a list of users and lets see more details about this users. The app has a backend developed with Node.js and a frontend using React. for the users is needed a data base to persist the information.

In order to make a more friendly development on this project, the frontend and the backend are in the same repository, so I did a monorepo.
